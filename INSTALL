Installation instructions for the Auxio finger client
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ensure that you are using at least Perl version 5 on any kind of
UNIX or derivatives.

Tested platforms include Linux 2.x, Solaris 2.x, HP/UX 10.20 and
FreeBSD.

	0. If your Perl binary is not installed in /usr/bin, open afinger in 
	   your favorite UNIX editor, and change the first line into the full
	   path to your Perl binary.

	1. The configuration file afinger.conf is expected to exist
	   in /usr/local/etc/ by default. 
	   If your wish to have this located elsewhere on your system, edit
	   afinger, and change the following line in the header:

	   my $config = '/usr/local/etc/afinger.conf';
	   into
	   my $config = 'PATH/TO/afinger.conf';

	   Now you should read and edit afinger.conf as you please.

	   Note: If afinger can't find afinger.conf, it will use the settings
	   inside afinger itself.

	3. Copy afinger to /usr/local/bin/ and afinger.conf to /usr/local/etc/
	   or any other path you might have set, and set the installed afinger
	   to be executable (`chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/afinger`).

	4. Optionally to let your finger daemon use afinger: 
	   Rename your current finger client.
	   Create a symbolic link that points from the original finger
	   location to the afinger location.
