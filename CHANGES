Changes in Auxio finger
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.43:
	Added support for displaying modification times of .plan and .project
	Fixed some quotes in the bofh cookie file.

v0.42:	
	Added support for using afinger as a simple CGI program.

v0.41:

	Support for an external configuration file has been added by
	Peter Jones.

	Arguments passed by a finger daemon are now being checked with
	Getopt(), which also brought support for the FreeBSD finger
	daemon (Peter Jones), and multiple queries at once.

	Overall code cleanup.

	CREDITS and INSTALL files added.
	
v0.4:
	A maximum UID can now be configured (default: 60000).

	getpwnam() is now being used, which has the advantages that besides 
	it's easier, NIS support was automagically added.

	Terminals and login times are now being displayed using 'who', which
	is much faster, allthough each OS has it's own idea of command
	switches.

	Fortune output is no longer configured by default.

v0.31:
	Input is now being more extensively being filtered for weird 
	characters such as *()|? etc. This wasn't dangerous before, but it
	could produce responses like...
	/^[:.*/: unmatched [] in regexp at /usr/bin/finger line 79, <PASSWD>
	 chunk 1.
        ..which isn't that nice to see.

	If a hostname can't be looked up in the DNS, a more sane response is
	now being given.

	Placed the .forward file check before the mail status check.	

v0.3:
	A mail status check has been added.
	
v0.2:
	You can now choose which part of the output will be displayed.
	This is only useful when using afinger together with a finger
	daemon. See the configuration options in the header of the 
	script.

v0.1:
	Initial release.
