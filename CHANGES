------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.45.1:

    Configuration file options:
    - Renamed nofinger to optoutfile
    - Renamed plnfile  to planfile
    - Renamed plntime  to planmtime
    - Renamed prjfile  to projfile
    - Renamed prjtime  to projmtime
    - Renamed mailspl  to mailspool
    - Renamed maxbyte  to network_recv

    - Added charcode, to set character encoding format if locale missing
    - Added cookielen, for maximum cookie length selection
    - Added network_timeo, to set a timeout when querying remote hosts
    - Added maxqry, maxqry_inet, maxqry_inet6, to query max. remote
      addresses.

    Afinger network:
    - Client now supports IPv4 and IPv6
    - Support for configurable timeouts in network queries
    - Max. number of resolved addresses to connect to (total, IPv4, IPv6)
      is supported via $maxqry, $maxqry_inet, $maxqry_inet6
    - Perl modules IO::Socket and IO::Select are now used
    - Remote host data is now received in buffers of $network_recv size
    - Added whohasips to show IP-addresses with terminals. See README.

    Afinger output:
    - Only the first line of .forward and .project is displayed
    - Updates to termscan to reflect changed GNU coreutils options
    - Updates to mailscan fixing Maildir++ atime/ctime info
    - Make sure that files can be read before trying to open them
    - Added support for codepages

v0.43:
    Added support for displaying modification times of .plan and .project
    Fixed some quotes in the bofh cookie file.

v0.42:
    Added support for using afinger as a simple CGI program.

v0.41:

    Support for an external configuration file has been added by
    Peter Jones.

    Arguments passed by a finger daemon are now being checked with
    Getopt(), which also brought support for the FreeBSD finger
    daemon (Peter Jones), and multiple queries at once.

    Overall code cleanup.

    CREDITS and INSTALL files added.

v0.4:
    A maximum UID can now be configured (default: 60000).

    getpwnam() is now being used, which has the advantages that besides 
    it's easier, NIS support was automagically added.

    Terminals and login times are now being displayed using 'who', which
    is much faster, allthough each OS has it's own idea of command
    switches.

    Fortune output is no longer configured by default.

v0.31:
    Input is now being more extensively being filtered for weird 
    characters such as *()|? etc. This wasn't dangerous before, but it
    could produce responses like...
    /^[:.*/: unmatched [] in regexp at /usr/bin/finger line 79, <PASSWD>
     chunk 1.
        ..which isn't that nice to see.

    If a hostname can't be looked up in the DNS, a more sane response is
    now being given.

    Placed the .forward file check before the mail status check.

v0.3:
    A mail status check has been added.

v0.2:
    You can now choose which part of the output will be displayed.
    This is only useful when using afinger together with a finger
    daemon. See the configuration options in the header of the 
    script.

v0.1:
    Initial release.
