The Auxio Finger Client - afinger
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
   A finger client is a user information lookup program, displaying
   information about login names, real names, shells, login times, idle
   times, telephone numbers etc.
   
   Unfortunately, it has become a bit of a threat to security to reveal
   all of the information about all logins on a system to everyone.
   
   afinger is a simple configurable finger client written in [1]Perl,
   and has been placed under the [2]GNU General Public License, or GNU GPL.
   It can be used together with a finger daemon and from the command
   line, honours a .nofinger file in home directories, you can set a
   minimum UID, use a Fortune program for erroneous requests, and
   virtually control each part of the returned information from the
   configuration options. 
   
   When used stand-alone, afinger will behave like any other finger
   client such as the one distributed with your operating system.
   
   If you decide to let remote users retrieve information about the users
   on your system, you will need a finger daemon. Mostly run from the
   inetd "super-server", the finger daemon listens for TCP requests
   received on port 79. Once a remote system connects, the finger daemon
   reads a single command line terminated by a <CRLF> which is passed to
   the local finger client. The finger daemon closes its connections as
   soon as all output is finished.
   
   Thus, if you replace your existing finger with afinger, and have a
   finger daemon running, it will use afinger to return the information
   requested by a local or remote user, with all fields controlled by
   either the system administrator or the "fingered" user him- or herself
   by placing a .nofinger file in the home directory.
   
   It might also be of interest that afinger does not honour finger
   relaying, for example user@host@anotherhost, even if the finger daemon
   has been configured this way. The in.fingerd manual page states
   regarding forwarding: "Useful behind firewalls, but probably not wise
   for security and resource reasons."

   Likewise, requests of the form finger @host are not being honoured,
   even if the finger daemon has been configured to allow this.

      option  default                                              explanation
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      login (for email forwarding) can be displayed.
      network   yes   Allow network queries (user@host). This isn't the same as
                      forwarding.
      login     yes   Display login name.
      name      yes   Display real name.

      office    yes   Display office location.
      phone     yes   Display home phone.
      plan      yes   Display $HOME/.plan file.
      proj      yes   Display $HOME/.project file.
      plntime   yes   Display .plan modification time
      prjtime   no    Display .project modification time
      mail      yes   Display mail status information.
      term      yes   Display terminal information.
      pub       yes   Display public key file.
      fortune   no    Use the Fortune program for errors.     
      usecgi    no    Use afinger as CGI script.
   
Output Examples
   
   afinger used locally on a user with an UID below the minimum level
   returning a Fortune cookie:

      $ afinger root
      Today's problem: Disk or processor on fire.

   Using afinger on a remote user with several fields omitted by afinger:

      $ afinger pkrul@www.auxio.org
      [www.auxio.org]
       Login:                                  Name: Pieter Krul
       Office:                                 Home Phone: +31185189642
       New mail received Mon Dec 25 00:45:38 2000
            Unread since Sun Dec 24 23:00:37 2000
       No Plan.

   It is also possible for instance to omit all fields, except a ~/.plan,
   to create output similar to the one returned when you finger
   linux@www.kernel.org
   
Fortunes
   
   The BOFH fortune cookie file (bofh.dat) is included in the afinger package.
   It is based on [3]The BOFH excuses by Jeff Ballard et al.
   This file can be copied to eg. /usr/share/games/fortunes/ or wherever
   the cookies may be placed on the system, and be used directly by the
   fortune program, if installed.
