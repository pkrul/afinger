The Auxio Finger Client - afinger

1. INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A finger client is a user information lookup program, displaying
information about login names, real names, shells, login times, idle times,
telephone numbers etc.

Unfortunately, it has become a bit of a threat to security to reveal all of
the information about all logins on a system to everyone.

afinger is a simple configurable finger client written in [1]Perl, and has
been placed under the [2]GNU General Public License, or GNU GPL.

It can be used together with a finger daemon and from the command line,
honours a .nofinger file in home directories, you can set a minimum UID, use
a Fortune program for erroneous requests, and virtually control each part of
the returned information from the configuration options. 

When used stand-alone, afinger will behave like any other finger client such
as the one distributed with your operating system.

If you decide to let remote users retrieve information about the users on
your system, you will need a finger daemon. Mostly run from the inetd 
"super-server", the finger daemon listens for TCP requests received on port
79. Once a remote system connects, the finger daemon reads a single command-
line terminated by a <CRLF> which is passed to the local finger client. The
finger daemon closes its connections as soon as all output is finished.

Thus, if you replace your existing finger with afinger, and have a finger
daemon running, it will use afinger to return the information requested by a
local or remote user, with all fields controlled by either the system
administrator or the "fingered" user him- or herself by placing a .nofinger
file in the home directory, which will disclose all information for this user.

It might also be of interest that afinger does not honour finger relaying,
for example user@host@anotherhost, even if the finger daemon has been 
configured this way. The in.fingerd manual page states regarding forwarding:
"Useful behind firewalls, but probably not wise for security and resource
reasons."

Likewise, requests of the form finger @host are not being honoured, even if
the finger daemon has been configured to allow this.

5. EXAMPLES
==============================================================================

Output Examples

afinger used locally on a user with an UID below the minimum level returning a
Fortune cookie:

   $ afinger root
   Today's problem: Disk or processor on fire.

Using afinger on a remote user with several fields omitted by afinger:

   $ afinger pkrul@www.auxio.org
   [www.auxio.org]
    Login:                                  Name: Pieter Krul
    Office:                                 Home Phone: +31185189642
    New mail received Mon Dec 25 00:45:38 2000
         Unread since Sun Dec 24 23:00:37 2000
    No Plan.

It is also possible for instance to omit all fields, except a ~/.plan, to
create output similar to the one returned when you finger linux@www.kernel.org

Using afinger on a remote user with all fields enabled:

$ finger pkrul@auxio.org

6. USING FORTUNE COOKIES
==============================================================================

The BOFH fortune cookie file (bofh.dat) is included in the afinger package, in
the cookies directory.
It is based on [3]The BOFH excuses by Jeff Ballard et al.
This file can be copied to eg. /usr/share/games/fortunes/ or wherever
the cookies may be placed on the system, and be used directly by the
fortune program, if installed.
